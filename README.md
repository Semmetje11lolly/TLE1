# 🌿 TLE1 - Physical & Mental Health App
ℹ️ This is the repository of Team 7 that will be used during the development process of our Health App for TLE1.
This file contains the rules we established for working together on this project.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Conventions
- We code in English (variables names etc.)
- Variables should be declared at the top of the file (camelCase), except for function specific variables, like i in for-loops.
- Keep the files organised in their respective folders, so JavaScript files go in js, CSS files go in css etc.
- Give JS and CSS files the same name as the HTML/PHP file, eg: index.php has an index.css and index.js file.

## 😺 GitHub Rules
- We use GitHub Desktop to pull, commit and push requests.
- When working on a specific feature, you do this on the specified branch.
- If you want to work on a certain file, make sure with the team there isn't already someone actively editing the file to minimise conflicts.
